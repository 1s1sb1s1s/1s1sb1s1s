            In the forests of Middle Earth,
            There lives a skilled elf of great worth,
            Her name is Isis, a mage of code,
            Who strives to lighten up the world's load.
	
            Born in July, the crab leads her way
            A wizard in training, she works every day,
            Learning new languages with all her might,
            To wield the power of code and bring light.
        
            With twenty years to her name,
            She seeks to learn the arts of code and game,
            Through forests deep and mountains tall,
            She pursues her dream with a steadfast call.	
        
            Her codes may be tangled and twisted,
            But she perseveres, undaunted and unassisted,
            With the determination of a knight in battle,
            She wields her keyboard with a valiant rattle.
        
            In Brazil she resides with cats and a hound,   
            Her life is a mess, but her magic abounds,
            JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are her weapons of choice,
            With Java and C# adding to her voice,
        
            She tried her hand at Python but found it not to be her taste,
            C++ waits in the wings, like a knight with haste.,
            With sword drawn and shield raised high,
            
            C++ strikes fear, making her code sigh.
            Python was a challenge she couldn't embrace,
            But C++, oh C++, he's a daunting face,
            Yet Isis persists, with a magician's touch,
            She'll conquer them all and learn so much.
            
            So let the journey continue on,
            As Isis and her coding skills dawn,
            For in the land of Middle Earth and beyond,
            Her legend shall live on and bond.
